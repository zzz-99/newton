**Newton** is a GPU-accelerated, extensible, and differentiable physics simulation engine designed for robotics, research, and advanced simulation workflows. Built on top of NVIDIA Warp and integrating MuJoCo Warp, Newton provides high-performance simulation, modern Python APIs, and a flexible architecture for both users and developers.


Key Features
------------

* **GPU-accelerated**: Leverages NVIDIA Warp for fast, scalable simulation.
* **Multiple solver implementations**: XPBD, VBD, MuJoCo, Featherstone, SemiImplicit.
* **Modular design**: Easily extendable with new solvers and components.
* **Differentiable**: Supports differentiable simulation for machine learning and optimization.
* **Rich Import/Export**: Load models from URDF, MJCF, USD, and more.
* **Open Source**: Maintained by Disney Research, Google DeepMind, and NVIDIA.

- **ModelBuilder**: Constructs models from primitives or imported assets.
- **Model**: Encapsulates the physical structure, parameters, and configuration.
- **State**: Represents the dynamic state (positions, velocities, etc.).
- **Solver**: Advances the simulation by integrating physics.
- **Viewer**: Visualizes the simulation in real-time or offline.
- **Importer**: Loads models from external formats (URDF, MJCF, USD).
